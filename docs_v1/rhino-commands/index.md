## `TunnyRunDashboard` Command

Sometimes you want to check Tunny's optimization results without opening
Grasshopper. In that case, use this command.

By selecting the target result file, you can launch Optuna-Dashboard to analyze
the results without having to launch Grasshopper.

## `TunnyGetLicense` Command

A license is required to use the full functionality of Tunny. If you have a
license based on the Subscriptions page, you can use this command to reflect the
license in Rhino.
