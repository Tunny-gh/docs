:fish:**Tunny**:fish: is Grasshopper's optimization component using Optuna, an
open source hyperparameter auto-optimization framework.

Tunny is inspired by components such as Galapagos,
[Opossum](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/opossum-optimization-solver-surrogate-models),
and [Wallacei](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/wallacei), and can be used in a
similar way to them.

Tunny has been wrapped around Optuna; it might be called Optuna's UI for
Grasshopper. For this reason, Optuna is also introduced. The following is taken
from the Optuna official website

> Optuna™, an open-source automatic hyperparameter optimization framework,
> automates the trial-and-error process of optimizing the hyperparameters. It
> automatically finds optimal hyperparameter values based on an optimization
> target. Optuna is framework agnostic and can be used with most Python
> frameworks, including Chainer, Scikit-learn, Pytorch, etc. Optuna is used in
> PFN projects with good results. One example is the second place award in the
> Google AI Open Images 2018 – Object Detection Track competition.
