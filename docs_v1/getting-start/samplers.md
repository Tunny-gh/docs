  Tunny is Grasshopper's optimization component using Optuna, an open source hyperparameter auto-optimization framework.
---

Tunny can utilize a number of sampling techniques.

The table below summarizes the optimizations supported by each sampler.
Note that Tunny's UI will automatically display the available methods depending on the problem.
