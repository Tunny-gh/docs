## Tunny Fishing

<img width="30%" alt="image" src="/images/docs_v1/gh-components/tunny-fishing.png">

The `Tunny Fishing` component is the most important component of Tunny.
Double-clicking the icon of this component will launch the optimization UI.

Connect variables to `Vars`, `Objs` to Objective Functions, `Attrs` to
Attributes, and `Artfs` to the file path or FishPrint you wish to associate.

Depending on this input, Tunny's UI will determine which samplers are available.

By right-clicking on a component, you can open the folder where the optimization
settings files and other files related to Tunny are located.

## Bone Fish

`Bone Fish` is a component that performs optimizations without a UI. It is like
a kangaroo zombie solver.

The optimization settings are the last saved settings. If you want to change
them, it is easy to launch Tunny's UI once from the Tunny Fishing component and
change them within it.
