  In this chapter of the Fresh documentation, you'll be introduced to the
  framework. Create a new project, run it locally, edit and create pages, fetch
  data, handle user interactions, and deploy it.

In this chapter of the Tunny documentation, you'll be introduced the components
included in Tunny. Tunny components can be found in the Tunny tab if it has been
installed.

| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Fish                     | Parameters for storing optimization results.                                                                                                                                         |
| Fish Attribute           | Parameters for optimization trial Attribute.                                                                                                                                         |
| Fish Egg                 | Parameters for combination of variables to be executed.                                                                                                                              |
| Construct Fish Attribute | Construct a Fish Attribute. It is attached to optimization results</br>For example, geometry, constraints, values you want to record other than the objective function and variables |
| Construct Fish Egg       | Construct Fish Eggs, which is the first combination of Variables that must be executed when performing optimization.                                                                 |
| Deconstruct Fish         | Deconstruct optimization results into a format that is easy to handle in Grasshopper.                                                                                                |
| Tunny                    | Components to perform optimization.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Fish Market              | Align optimization results in Rhino's viewport to make it easier to find the optimization results you need, like in a fish market.                                                   |
