`Fish Print by Capture` is a component that creates image files that can be
input into the Tunny Fishing component Artfs.

As the name “Capture” implies, it captures the active Rhino viewport at each
optimization step and registers it in Atrfs. Once registered in Artfs, the image
can be viewed in Optuna-Dashoboard.
