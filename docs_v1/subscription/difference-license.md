## How to Activate License

The license is given as a Rhino Cloud Zoo license. Please use the given license
code starting with “TUNY-” and register it in your Rhino account.

Once the license is registered in your Rhino account, you can run the
`TunnyGetLicense` command in Rhino to activate the license in Grasshopper.

The license is checked when the Tunny window is opened. If you forget to get the
license, close the window once, execute the above command, and reopen the Tunny
window.
