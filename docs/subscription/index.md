Since version 1,
Tunny requires a license for full functionality.

However, since Tunny v1 is still in experimental phase,
there is no fee for the license.
If you need a license, please apply for one from the following e-mail address.

The subject of the email should be **“Tunny License Request”**.

| Community    | This is when there is no valid license.  The sampler can only use `AUTO Sampler` and `Random Sampler`. Other than that, the functions are the same as other types. |
| Professional | All functions are available.                                                                          |
