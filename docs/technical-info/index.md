  This section describes how to support Tunny development.

This chapter introduces the technical characteristics of each sampler.

It is intended to provide a starting point for understanding which sampler uses
which algorithm for sampling and for learning about optimization, rather than to
describe the specific processing using mathematical formulas, etc.

The details of the actual calculations using mathematical formulas, etc., are
given only in the reference papers.
