- The **Fish** component, a Param component dedicated to Tunny, was created to
  facilitate data handling.
  - You can internalize and save the results to a .gh file.
- The **FishMarket** component allows the results obtained from optimization to
  be viewed side by side just like a fish market.
- The **Deconstruct Fish** and **Deconstruct Fish Attribute** components are
  used to retrieve each value.
  - The DeconstructFishAttribute component, like the ExplodeTree component,
    creates Outputs for the number of Attributes by selecting Match outputs from
    the context menu.
